`jsrw` is a tiny, header-only library for parsing JSON data directly into C++ custom objects. It is most useful when memory footprint and performance are critical because it doesn't need intermediate data structures to keep the parsed JSON data in memory.

Key Features:

- Header-only and lightweight: jsrw is a header-only library with just 513 lines of code.
- Small memory footprint: with a focus on efficiency, jsrw maintains a small memory footprint, optimizing resource usage even in memory-constrained environments.
- Performance optimization: jsrw is designed for optimal performance, eliminating the need for separate data structures for parsed JSON.
- JSON writing support: jsrw provides an overloaded `<<` operator to help write strings into streams correctly and efficiently.
